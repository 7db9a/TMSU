First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this project! Please get in [contact](mailto:paul.ruane@oniony.com?subject=Contributing%20to%20TMSU) to chat about what you would like to work on, though the [TODO list](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/wiki/TODO) and [issue
tracker](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/issues) are good places to start.

I built this project for several reasons:

  * I disliked the opaque, proprietary solutions available for tagging files
  * I wanted to learn a new programming language
  * I wanted to have a pet project to work upon outside of work

Once you have found something you would like to work on, please do not go off and squirrel away at a massive pull-request that
I will inevitably not want to accept. It is far better if you communicate often and keep the pull requests small: baby steps.
That way we can make any corrections to approach before too much time has been invested.
