First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this project! Please get in [contact](mailto:paul.ruane@oniony.com?subject=Contributing%20to%20TMSU) to chat about what you would like to work on, though the [TODO list](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/wiki/TODO) and [issue
tracker](https://github.com/oniony/TMSU/issues) are good places to start.

I built this project for several reasons:

  * I disliked the opaque, proprietary solutions available for tagging files
  * I thought the idea of presenting tagged files as a virtual filesystem was unique (it transpires it wasn't)
  * I wanted to learn a new programming language
  * I wanted to have a pet project to work upon outside of work

Once you have found something you would like to work on, please do not go off and squirrel away at a giagantic pull-request. It would be far better if we could communicate often and keep the pull requests small and tightly scoped so that they're easier to understand and so that it's not disheartening if it stuff to be changed.

Thanks again, I look forward to collaborating with you.

Paul
